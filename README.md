# pull-up-counter
A simple pull-up counter that can hang above a pull-up bar or fingerboard. The counter simply accumulates all registered pull-ups, and stores the number in case of shutdown. 

The number can be manually adjusted with the tactile switches. In order to reset the counter to 0, the RESET button must be held in for 2 seconds.
